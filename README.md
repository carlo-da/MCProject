## Getting Started

Cyber Guard is a cross-platform mobile app built with Flutter/Dart that helps users improve their cybersecurity awareness and maintain strong online security practices.

The Password Generator allows users to create strong, random passwords using letters, numbers, and special characters. Users can adjust the length of the password to their preference and copy the generated password to the clipboard for easy use.

The Password Checker provides real-time feedback on the strength of a password as it is typed. Password strength is indicated with a dynamic color animation ranging from weak to very strong, helping users understand what makes a secure password. Users can also copy the password to the clipboard after checking.

The Breach Checker allows users to verify whether a password has appeared in known data breaches. It gives immediate visual feedback, showing red for breached passwords and green for safe ones, helping users make informed decisions about password security.

The Cybersecurity News Feed aggregates articles from multiple trusted RSS sources to keep users informed about the latest cybersecurity news and threats. Users can pull to refresh the feed, see the last updated timestamp, and open articles in their default browser.

Cyber Guard combines these features with a clean, modern interface, centered elements, and contextual subtitles to guide the user on each screen, making cybersecurity awareness accessible and easy to understand.
